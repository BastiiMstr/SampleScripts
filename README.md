# SampleScripts
Samples of my code

Hello im Sebastian Rokowski</br>
I am begginer at programming and in this repository you can find some pieces of my code.</br>
In 90% I'm sure that I would be able to improve them. </br>
This code was written some time ago and I think that I learned something new that I could use to make this code better.</br>

In javaBasicProgram(whole) directory I gave You 2 whole programs scripts to show how my writing style is when I have enough time to do it.</br>
On the other hand notProudOfMain.cpp is the script when I had very very little amount of time and knowledge how to make it work so I can say that I speedruned that game.

What else</br>
Im still learning and I think that i can learn really fast. Im open minded type of person so I might have a lot of ideas how to do a task.</br>
I use GitHub to switch fast between my 2 devices so im know basics of it.</br>

My cons:</br>
I have trouble to manage time on long time period. I like to have deadline max to weeks ahead, because I have tendency to leave something for later. </br>
When I try something new without help, it can take me a lot of time to do it. But when I done one thing earlier I can recreate it really fast.
